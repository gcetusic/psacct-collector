Description: This project has been developed as a 2011 summer project for CERN Openlab to replace the old accounting scripts developed for the CERN grid.
The code is a rewrite of the Open Science Grid Gratia project, the psacct probe part written in Python to be exact.
Although a lot of effort has been put in the rewrite, a good amount of the original code is still included. Thank you, OSG Gratia team!
